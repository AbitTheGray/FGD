# FGD

This project is a storage of [FGD files](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/FGD) (Entity Definitions for games running on [GoldSrc](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GoldSrc) / [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) engines) for archivation purpose.
At the creation of this repo, it was already difficult to find some [GoldSrc](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GoldSrc) FGD files.

If you have an official FGD file which is missing or widely-used community one, feel free to create a Pull Request to expand this archive.
This is also the reason why this repo is not archived itself.

For modern/rewritten FGD files look into [SEFGD](https://github.com/Pinsplash/SEFGD).
